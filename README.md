WP-Forge is a next-generation WordPress theme framework that takes modern development practices to the next level. Built from the ground up with TypeScript, Vite, and cutting-edge tooling, it's designed to make WordPress theme development fast, type-safe, and enjoyable.

## 🎯 Why WP-Forge?

While inspired by excellent frameworks like WPRig, WP-Forge goes further:

- ✅ **TypeScript-First**: Full type safety across PHP and JavaScript
- ⚡ **Vite-Powered**: Lightning-fast HMR and build times
- 🧩 **Component Registry**: Share and reuse components across projects
- 🤖 **AI-Assisted**: Built-in AI tools for development (optional)
- 🎨 **Design System Integration**: Choose Tailwind, UnoCSS, or vanilla CSS
- 🧪 **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, E2E, and visual regression tests
- 📱 **Performance-First**: Automatic critical CSS, lazy loading, and optimization
- 🔌 **Headless-Ready**: First-class support for decoupled architectures
- 🎭 **Component Explorer**: Built-in Storybook-like component browser
- 📦 **Modern Tooling**: Monorepo, Turbo, pnpm, and more
